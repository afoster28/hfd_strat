# Approaches undertaken

This part should describe **with all the details** what particular methods you used, all entry/exit techniques considered, all additional assumptions.

For **each group of assets separately** You should also explain **WHAT different parameters** you considered (e.g. memories of moving averages, types of moving averages, types of volatility measures, memory of volatility measures, types of additional indicators, memories of additional indicators, etc.), what (if any) additional filtering rules you applied.

You should also explain with details **HOW** you searched for the best combination of parameters for a particular group of assets.

# Group 1 -- summary of results (including out-of-sample)

## Finally selected strategy for group 1

Provide **all the details** (approach and a set of **final parameters**) for assets from **group 1**.
(e.g. momentum strategy, cross over of two exponential moving averages EMA10 and EMA60, additional filtering, methods or indicators used).


<!-- here you can include code chunk that applies the strategy for group 1 and calculates all the summary statistics
-->

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
# here you can refer to the R codes that apply the strategy
# for asset group 1 to all quarters (in a loop)
source("apply_my_strategy_group1.R")
```

## Summary of results for group 1

```{r, echo = F}
names(quarter_stats.all.group1)[5] <- "av.ntrades"
kable(quarter_stats.all.group1[, -2], 
                    "markdown", 
                    digits = 2,
                    align = "r")

# Group 2 -- summary of results (including out-of-sample)

## Finally selected strategy for group 2

Provide **all the details** (approach and a set of **final parameters**) for assets from **group 2**.
(e.g. momentum strategy, cross over of two exponential moving averages EMA10 and EMA60 applied to EVERY single asset separately and then putting individual results into the portfolio).

<!-- here you can include code chunk that applies the strategy for group 2 and calculates all the summary statistics
-->

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
# here you can refer to the R codes that apply the strategy
# for asset group 2 to all quarters (in a loop)
source("apply_my_strategy_group2.R")
```
